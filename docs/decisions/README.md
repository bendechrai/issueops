# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the project.

## What is an ADR?

An ADR is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences.

## When to Write an ADR

Write an ADR when you make a decision about:
- Technology choices (languages, frameworks, databases)
- Architectural patterns (how components communicate)
- Development practices (testing strategy, deployment approach)
- Third-party services or APIs
- Breaking changes to existing patterns

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows this structure:

1. **Title** - Short description of the decision
2. **Status** - Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, or Superseded
3. **Context** - What situation requires a decision?
4. **Decision** - What was decided?
5. **Consequences** - What are the implications?

## Index

_ADRs will be listed here as they are created._
